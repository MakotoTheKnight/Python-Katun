You must have the following software installed:

- SQLite 3.7.4 or newer (sqlite.org)
- Python SQLite bindings (http://code.google.com/p/pysqlite/)

---

- Website
- Retrieving data from user's computer
- Playlists and Favorites

KNOWN BUGS
---

- Parser is incredibly slow on sufficiently large music collections, likely north of 5,000.  This is being looked into.

SQLITE3-RELATED:
- A song can appear twice on the same playlist, or in favorites.  This issue is likely due to Python's implementation of Sqlite3 not respecting the PRAGMA foreign_keys.  This is being looked into.
